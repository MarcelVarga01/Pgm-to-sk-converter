The size of the converted fractal.sk file is 250,300 bytes.
The attached program converts 200 x 200 pgm files with a maximum gray value of 255.
The pixels are drawn as lines, so for each sequence of pixels that are on the same line and have the same colour, a line is drawn.
After the end of a line in the initial .pgm file, the tool is set to none so the x and y are updated to the next line, column 0.
